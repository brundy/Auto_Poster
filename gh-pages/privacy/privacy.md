# Privacy Policy for Auto_Poster

[Back to Home](../index.html)

**Effective Date:** June 1, 2025

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy outlines how Auto_Poster collects, uses, stores, and protects information in connection with my personal use of n8n software ("n8n") for automating tasks, including but not limited to posting on social media platforms such as Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), LinkedIn, and Facebook ("Social Media Platforms").

This automation and associated data handling are for my personal use and management. If this Privacy Policy is provided in the context of a Meta App or other third-party service requirement, it is to describe these personal data processing activities.

## 2. Information I Collect
As the operator and primary user of my n8n instance, I collect and process the following types of information:

* **Credentials:** OAuth tokens, API keys, usernames, passwords, and other authentication data required to connect n8n to my accounts on Social Media Platforms and other third-party services. These are stored securely within my n8n instance.
* **Content Data:** Text, images, videos, links, and other content that I create or source and provide to my n8n workflows for the purpose of automated posting or other tasks.
* **Workflow Data:** The configuration of my n8n workflows, including logic, scheduling information, and parameters.
* **Execution Logs:** Logs generated by n8n during workflow execution, which may include timestamps, status of operations, error messages, and data processed during the execution. This data is used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and improving my automations.
* **Data from Social Media Platforms:** When my n8n workflows interact with Social Media Platforms, they may receive data in return, such as post IDs, confirmation of actions, or error codes.

My n8n instance is "hosted by a n8n.io where I manage the instance and its data"].

## 3. How I Use Information
I use the collected information for the following purposes:

* To set up, operate, and maintain my n8n automation workflows.
* To authenticate my n8n instance with my accounts on Social Media Platforms and other services.
* To automatically publish content, manage interactions, or perform other tasks on Social Media Platforms as defined by my n8n workflows.
* To monitor the execution and performance of my automations.
* For personal record-keeping, troubleshooting, and improving the efficiency of my automated tasks.

## 4. Data Storage, Security, and Retention
* All data processed by my n8n workflows, including credentials and content, is stored within my n8n instance and its associated data storage, under my control.
* I take reasonable technical and organizational measures to secure the information stored in my n8n instance. These measures include [Describe your measures, e.g., "using strong, unique passwords for my n8n instance and connected accounts," "keeping my n8n software and server environment up-to-date," "implementing firewall rules," "using encrypted connections (HTTPS) where possible," "regularly backing up my n8n data"].
* I retain data within my n8n instance for as long as it is needed for the operation of my workflows or as I deem necessary for my personal records. I am responsible for deleting data from my n8n instance when it is no longer needed.

## 5. Data Sharing and Disclosure
I do not sell, rent, or trade my personal information. Information is shared with third parties only in the following limited circumstances:

* **With Social Media Platforms:** Content data and necessary authentication tokens are shared with the respective Social Media Platforms (e.g., Meta for Instagram/Facebook, X, LinkedIn) solely for the purpose of executing the automated tasks as defined in my n8n workflows (e.g., publishing a post). The handling of this data by the Social Media Platforms is subject to their respective privacy policies.
* **Legal Requirements:** I may disclose information if required to do by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect my rights, or prevent fraud or abuse.

Other than the above, no data processed by my personal n8n automation is shared with external third parties.

## 6. Your Data Rights
Since this automation is for my personal use and I am the controller of the data within my n8n instance, I exercise my data rights directly by managing my n8n setup. This includes the right to:

* **Access:** I can access all data within my n8n instance, including workflow configurations, logs, and stored credentials.
* **Rectification:** I can modify or correct any data within my n8n workflows or stored by my n8n instance.
* **Erasure ('Right to be Forgotten'):** I can delete specific data, credentials, execution logs, or entire workflows from my n8n instance at any time.
* **Control:** I have full control over the configuration, execution, and data processing of my n8n workflows.

## 7. Third-Party Services
My n8n automation interacts with various third-party Social Media Platforms. My interaction with these platforms via the API is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. I encourage you (as the reader of this policy, typically Meta for app review) to review their policies:
* Meta (Facebook & Instagram): [e.g., https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/)
* X (Twitter): [e.g., https://twitter.com/en/privacy](https://twitter.com/en/privacy)
* LinkedIn: [e.g., https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy)


## 8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies
My backend n8n automation workflows themselves do not typically use cookies or similar tracking technologies to track website visitors, as they operate as a server-side automation tool. If my n8n instance is configured to be accessible via a web browser and uses cookies for session management or other UI functionalities provided by n8n itself, these are standard functional cookies. I do not use them for tracking users for advertising or other similar purposes.

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in my data handling practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If I make changes, I will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. As this policy pertains to my personal use, significant changes would reflect my own decisions on data management.
